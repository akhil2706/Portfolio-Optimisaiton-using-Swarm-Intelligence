# Portfolio-Optimisation-using-Swarm-Intelligence

Optimising a set of 4 differently sized portfolio baskets using swarm intelligence algorithms. The feasibility, convergence and performance of these algorithms are compared and the most suitable algorithms for this problem domain are outlines. Algorithms used in this study are: Mircobat Echolocation, Cuckoo Search, Harmony Search, Flower Pollination Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimisation & Elephant Herd Optimisation. The optimisation surface used for this problem is Sharpe Ratio optimisation and VaR weighted return. 

## Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites 

This project requires a R environment with the following dependencies: 
1) matlib 
2) readxl
 
### Installation

The code for the strategy has been implemented in the .Rmd file included in the repository and can be replicated with the consent of the contributors. The parameters and implementation strategy is outlined in an academic paper presented at IEEE's GUCON 2018 under the title 'Application of Swarm Intelligence to Portfolio Optimisation' and can be viewed on IEEE Digital Xplore. 

## Testing 

The R notebook contains the code and the descriptive comments which debrief about the functions used. The correlation matrix for each portfolio size has been computed individually and stored in files in the repository. This computation has not been included in the repository and can be computed individually.
